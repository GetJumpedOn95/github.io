	<h4>Hypothesis:</h4>
	<p>I believe that the Insertion Sort will be the fastest sorting algorithm. This is because insertion sort
iterates through the list and compares an element to the element before it. If the two elements are not sorted, then they are swapped. This leads to the insertion sort being able to iterate through the array very quickly only having to swap a few variables or none.  In the case where the list is already ordered, this process will be very quick.
	<p>I believe Bubble Sort would be the slowest because it is the simplest sorting algorithm. The logic for this sort is that the list to be sorted has must  iterated through completely and two adjacent elements are compared with each other. If they are out of order, then those two are swap. The list is completely iterated over and over until there are no swaps for one iteration. I believe this leads to a lot of extra processing and will take longer.
	<p>For Selection Sort, the full list is transverse each time to find the lowest value element and places that at "next in line" element. That is to say that the first iteration through the list finds the lowest element and places that at slot 0 in the array. The next iteration searches the list minus the one element at 0 and find the next lowest element. It places that at spot 1 in the array. This goes on until the array is sorted. The downside is that the processing logic requires searching the full remaining list for each iteration and that can waste a lot of processing.

	<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
	<p>From analysis the results from the three sorting algorithms, Insertion Sort is the fastest sorting algorithm between Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort. Selection Sort was the next best and Bubble Sort was the slowest. My hypothesis was correct that all the extra iterations through the unsorted list done by Bubble Sort and Selection Sort caused them to be slower. Insertion sort was the fastest when the list was already sorted. This is because it only had to iterating through the list once. This also causes it go gain performance when the list is some what sorted.
