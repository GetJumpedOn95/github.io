  <h1>Considered Business Proposals</h1>

<p>In the writing to market his product, he makes multiple typos showing a lack of care for his project. He demonstrates short and unclear goals that make very broad promises without detailing and of the specifics of the project. He writes very short descriptions of what he wanted to accomplish, making me wonder if he even knows what his goals are. I don’t feel confident in join the group, due to the lack of care, and lack of direction of the group.</p>

<p>The project made by this group is impractical and would be detrimental to the rest of society. School buses already leave at time to where students get to class on time. Turning the lights green for only school bus routes would be incredibly inefficient for almost everyone else on the road. Overall, the idea is not well thought out and should not be implemented.</p>

<p>Their group project idea is to make a city planner calendar that is more accessible. This would ensure that more people are more aware of the events that are happening in their community. Their main competitor is google and I think that anything they come up with, would be overshadowed by how  gigantic google is. I think a better solution to this would be to make the already existing website better or make a new one on google. Additionally I don’t think this is the correct problem they should be addressing. The problem is that people don’t care enough to find out about events in their city and go to them, not that people care and they can’t find out about the events.</p>

<p>This project's main purpose is to detect parking lot spaces and show users which spots are open. The app will show different icons depending on the parking location. For example if a spot is taken it will show red and if it’s open it will display green. The first problem I have with this idea is that people would be using this application while driving which could lead to people not paying attention and getting into accidents while driving. Another problem I have is that setting up motion detectors and sensors into every single parking space would be extremely expensive and not practical.</p>

<p>I like the idea because it seems generally useful. It is a service that can be almost universally applied to anyone that is cooking. The reason I decided not to do it however is the fact that making an effective app like this would require hundreds of different combinations of ingredients. Additionally, apps like this already exist and this isn’t adding anything new that would set it apart from the competitors. I fear that this would just be overlooked and over shadowed as there is nothing innovative that would encourage people to switch over.</p>

<p>This caught my eye because it seemed very unique. But I do not want to do this because it doesn’t seem like something that people would buy. A spinning TV seems like it would take up more space than it would save. This seems like a gimmick that isn’t really needed, as you can just turn the tv manually if you really need to rotate it. Additionally, this product does not seem like something that requires computer science.</p>

<p>No specific target audience mentioned which means that the product is not going to sell since they have no audience in mind. No desire to compete with competitors and poor marketing campaigns. Additionally, the revenue stream isn't consistent as in-game goods are their only form of monetization. Adding ads may help even out the revenue stream and increase the overall viability of the business venture.</p>

<p>While a good idea, it’s a very competitive market. There’s already veterans in this industry like iBUYPower and NZXT Build. Additionally, they have no unique idea to compete in this market. The proposal also requires high startup costs for collecting parts and start selling. Also, teens interested in PC gaming are more likely to buy parts on their own and build the pc themselves, which makes it seem like there is no market for this.</p>

<p>I heavily considered this plan because of the complexity and how unrealistic it is. There seems to be a lot of thought put in and it seems they  worked very hard on this proposal plan. But I decided to reject it due to the severe software complexity that a project such as this would require, and the fact that a small high school group would not be able to afford this kind of program.</p>

 <p> We choose to endorse our own project because we feel it has a valid marketing strategy, has a target audience in mind, and has a problem that we provide a good solution to. Our project idea is to implement RFID scanners into entrances of schools so that the schools can see who has an ID when entering the school and who doesn’t. This ensures that people who don’t go to the school can’t enter undetected and that students without ID’s are caught. This would replace the security guards that usually check the ID’s. This would free up the labor and would ensure that people can’t just sneak into the building in a large crowd and remain undetected. The project also isn’t very costly because the RFID chips are very inexpensive and the scanners only need to be implemented in the entrances of the schools.</p>
