    <h1>17-April-2023</h1>
<p>This week I plan to add times to the schedule for Allen High School and the Steam Center. This will help the user creating a mock schedule to have an idea of when this will occur in the day.    </p>

    <p>  <A HREF="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-ModelScheduler/issues/154">Issue to Work - Add the Times Associated with the Class Periods on the Schedule Displayed on the Model Scheduler Page </A></p>
    <h1>10-April-2023</h1>
    <p>
<p>      A technical challenge I encountered was going through the ISP and being concerned about making changes. The reason I was apprehensive was that I didn’t want to mess up something or change something someone was working on. I ended up just looking for things that are already completed and updating it.
</p>
    <p>  A scheduling challenge I encountered was finding the time to look over the ISP. This was difficult because I had a lot of work in other classes and had to study for a lot of tests. I ended up just doing these changes over the weekend when I had more free time to work on the ISP.
</p>
     <p> An interpersonal challenge I had was coordinating with everyone on what we are going to do. A Lot of people are already done and are finished with the ISP and don't want to do anymore work. I ended up just working by myself and looking for things that might need changes to get things done this week.</p>

    <h1>3-April-2023</h1>
    <p>A technical challenge I faced this week was trying to find fixes to optimize the performance of the model scheduler. This was difficult because the model scheduler is fairly well optimized and works well in my opinion. It was also hard to find problems that weren’t already fixed or being taken care of.
    </p>
    <p>A scheduling challenge I faced was finding the time and the will to actually do anything with the model scheduler. We have already finished and everyone is pretty much done using it, so it seems pointless to do anything else to the scheduler. Even though I felt this way I still did testing and looked for ways to make it the best it can possibly be.
    </p>
    <p>An Interpersonal challenge I faced was that nobody was working on the model scheduler this week because we have already finished pretty much. This is not really surprising, but it means that additional progress is extremely slow and not much is getting done.This will probably be fixed next week when people finish the mission that was assigned. </p>
    
    <h1>20-March-2023</h1>
    <p>One technical challenge I faced was trying to find bugs that need to be fixed and testing for any errors that users might encounter. I also had a hard time finding things that needed to be done now instead of finding small bugs that could be ironed out later. This caused problems because we really need to focus on big issues that could harm the user experience and fix them right away.</p>

    <p>A scheduling challenge I faced was finding time to work on the ISP while my other classes gave out a lot of work for me to complete. To counteract this I ended up doing most of my work in class which did help alleviate the stress. Another issue we faced was getting everyone to look at the discord on a regular basis so that they are up to date with what needs to be done.</p>

    <p>An interpersonal challenge we faced was trying to deal with the person who stole our model scheduler. It was very difficult to find and deal with this person in a nice way that also got them to get rid of their stolen work. We are still trying to figure this out and has caused alot of frustration for the entire group.</p>
      
    <h1>13-March-2023</h1>
    <p>One technical challenge I faced was finding out what Modals are exactly and how best to implement them into our module scheduler. It was difficult to accurately implement it in a non intrusive and helpful way. Additionally it was difficult to modify the already existing Html in a way that made the modal's work as intended.</p>

    <p>A scheduling challenge I faced was trying to finalize all the details for the model scheduler, because the due date was moved to this week. We had a lot of little UI problems and a couple big ones that needed to be ironed out before the due date. It was also difficult to interact and determine what needed to be done with people in a timely manner that fit into when I could work on the schedule.</p>

    <p>An interpersonal challenge I faced was finding out where the modals needed to be and how exactly they wanted them to look and be implemented into the finished product. This led to me having to wait a day because I was confused on what exactly was wanted from me. It was also difficult to always remember to pull everytime I login because if I don’t it could mess up a lot of things.</p>

    <h1>27-Feb-2023</h1>
    <p>One technical challenge I faced was trying to fix all of the little bugs and details before we submit our model scheduler. It was hard to identify and test for all the little things that can and need to be improved.Additionally I had a difficult time trying to find all the code other people worked on to try and work on it to improve the scheduler.</p>

    <p>A scheduling challenge I faced was trying to finish all the work we needed to before the due date this week. We needed to finalize the entire project this week so it was difficult to do all of that before spring break. We also had a hard time trying to do work because of the half day on friday and SAT day on wednesday which dramatically cut our class time.</p>

    <p>An interpersonal challenge I faced was trying to get all of the team members to work together to complete the project. It was hard to raise everyone's morale enough to finish the project right before the deadline and spring break. It was also difficult to find out what other people were already working on and what I needed to do myself.</p>
      

    <h1>20-Feb-2023</h1>
    <p>
      One technical challenge that I faced this week was trying to design the color scheme for the home page. The home page had a unique design and it was hard to find the right color combination for it to fit with the rest of the scheduler. Eventually after trying out a bunch of color combinations I finally landed on a design that flowed very nicely with the rest of the project.
    </p>

    <p>
      A scheduling challenge I faced was trying to find the time to do my work for the project. I had a lot of tests and quizzes, so finding the time to do the model scheduler in between was challenging. However I did find the time and I did finish the login page for the model scheduler on time.I also had trouble remembering to actually commit the changes once I had finished.
    </p>

    <p>An interpersonal challenge I faced this week was trying to find a color scheme everyone in the group agreed with. This was challenging because everyone had their own idea on how the login page should look and how it should flow with the rest of the scheduler as a whole. Eventually we did compromise and decide on a color scheme that doesn’t overly offend anyone.

    <h1>13-Feb-2023</h1>
	<p>A  technical challenge that I faced this week was figuring out how to change the css to make the schedular go into dark mode. This was difficult because I had to figure out how to make 2 different styles go into the same css file which I previously had no idea how to do. Additionally I had to figure out how to freely change between the 2 in a seamless way that doesn’t cause any problems or look bad</p>

	<p>A scheduling challenge I faced was trying to get all of this done before the presentations on wednesday. This caused me to shift my priorities from other classes and purely focus on accomplishing all my tasks before we had to present all of our collective efforts on wensday, to the entire class for a grade.</p>

	<p>An interpersonal challenge I faced was trying to figure out what all we had to finish by wednesday and what components were not essential for the presentation itself. It was also difficult to figure out what other people were working on because not everybody has said what they are trying to accomplish within the project.</p>

    <h1>6-Feb-2023</h1>
    <p> One technical challenge I faced this week was trying to gain access to the model scheduler. We have 2 different drafts that are being created at the same time and it was difficult to get the information to gain access to both of the model schedulers that I needed to help enhance. It was also difficult to login to the model scheduler because I didn’t know the password and it wasn’t really working.</p> 

   <p>A scheduling challenge I faced was trying to get in touch with different members of the project and having them respond quickly so I could make changes. This made it a lot slower and more tedious to make changes because I needed to ask people what they did or what they wanted me to change on the scheduler. </p>

   <p>An interpersonal challenge I faced was communicating with the group on what needed to be done and when. It was also difficult to figure out what other people were working on which made it hard to do work because I didn’t know if someone was already working on a specific part of the project. This was later fixed with jobs being distributed to each individual person so that we all knew what we had to get done.</p> 

    <h1>27-Jan-2023</h1>
    <p>A technical challenge I faced this week was fine tuning the look of the models we needed. This was to ensure that everyone was on the same page on what to do. I am still struggling with using canva and some of its components are confusing at best and bad at worst. This did however make it so that I am very skilled with canva.</p>

    <p>A scheduling challenge we faced was finding when to work on the project. This week was pretty much just the quiz so we had no time to work on it in class. This caused significant decreases in productivity across the board. This caused pretty much nothing overly important being completed this week as we were all focused on the quiz.</p>

    <p>An interpersonal challenge I faced was still trying to get what the group wanted the website to look like on to canva. It’s kind of hard to make it exactly how they want with just a few sentences told to me. This is why I had to go back and do over some of the parts the group didn’t agree on. I do think however that it did turn out good in the end after a couple of changes done.</p>
      
    <h1>20-Jan-2023</h1>
   <p>A technical challenge I faced this week using canva. I had to make models of how the finished product would look like for our group. To accomplish this goal I had to figure out how canva works and make multiple different models in different styles. This proved to be challenging because I have never used canva and it was foreign to me. </p>

   <p>A scheduling challenge we faced was getting everyone together to discuss what to do. This was difficult because not everyone regularly checks the discord to see new developments. This leads to some people being out of the loop and confused. This week was especially bad because we had Monday off and it took some getting used to, to get back into the swing of things. </p>

   <p>An interpersonal challenge I faced was communicating with my team leader on what exactly I was supposed to do. I was really confused on what I needed to do and I felt that I needed a lot more details and direction on where exactly they wanted the finished project to look like. I remedied the situation by making multiple different drafts of how the website could look in the end. </p>
   
    <h1>9-Jan-2023</h1>
	<p>
	  A big technical challenge I faced this week was github. My shell and github were not linked together so I had to try and connect them together. This was extremely confusing and took a while to complete. Even though I did find this hard it did help me understand more about github and how it works. This is sure to come in handy in the future with the model scheduler.
</p>
	 <p> Some scheduling challenges I faced this week was being confused on what exactly the other periods have completed. This led to me being behind on what they have already done. This led to me doing some extra work that was not needed in the end. Lastly it lead to me looking more closely at comments and what certain people have uploaded to github already.
</p>
	 <p> Some interpersonal challenges we faced in the group were deciding the jobs. Some people wanted to do jobs that already had enough members and some people didn’t want to do jobs that needed to be filled up. We rectified this by having a voting system where we voted for the project manager which was a contested spot. This led to the product manager sorting out who's doing what.	  </p>

    <p><b><i>QA Engineer</i></b></p>
    <p>A Quality Assurance Engineer’s role is to look at the product and test for bugs before its release. This ensures the product works as intended and provides a satisfying experience. Additionally, it is their job to collaborate with developers to fix these bugs so that the customer gets the best experience possible. Without these members on the team the final product will be untested and thus be filled with bugs that would hinder the users experience.
<p><b><i>Project Manager </i></b></p>
    <p>A Project Manager's job is to lead the team working on the project to achieve all of their goals in the given time constraints. Additionally, they make sure that the project does not go over budget so as to not be profitable.  They work to make sure that everyone is working on the correct thing and that the team works diligently. Without these members on the team the team would not have anyone to make sure that they complete the project on time, within the budget, and that the teams as a whole was working on the correct things.</p>
      
    <p><b><i>Development Manager </i></b></p>
    <p>The role of the Development Manager in the group is to make the goals a reality. They additionally provide designs for the projects which help everyone else know how exactly the project should work. This is a very important job because if the whole team was not on the same page on what exactly the finished product will be, then the project would be a jumbled mess. The last role of a development engineer is to oversee a new product or series of products being produced.</p>
      
    <p><b><i>Product Manager </i></b></p>
    <p> The role of the Product Manager in a group is to look at what the consumers want from the product which ensures that the consumers would not be disappointed. This also ensures that the company will make a profit from the product. They also dictate what success would look like for the company financially. Additionally, they rally the time together so that they feel motivated to complete the project.</p>
      
    <p><b><i>Release Engineer </i></b></p>
      <p>The role the Release Engineer is to compile all the base code written. They then assemble this  base code written into the final product. Afterwards they deliver it into the correct points of the product so as to bring the project to life. The release engineers basically add all the moving parts together to bring the product into fruition.</p>
