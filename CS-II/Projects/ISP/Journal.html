<h1>5-Feb-2023</h1>

    <h1>27-Jan-2023</h1>
    <p>A technical challenge I faced this week was fine tuning the look of the models we needed. This was to ensure that everyone was on the same page on what to do. I am still struggling with using canva and some of its components are confusing at best and bad at worst. This did however make it so that I am very skilled with canva.</p>

    <p>A scheduling challenge we faced was finding when to work on the project. This week was pretty much just the quiz so we had no time to work on it in class. This caused significant decreases in productivity across the board. This caused pretty much nothing overly important being completed this week as we were all focused on the quiz.</p>

    <p>An interpersonal challenge I faced was still trying to get what the group wanted the website to look like on to canva. It’s kind of hard to make it exactly how they want with just a few sentences told to me. This is why I had to go back and do over some of the parts the group didn’t agree on. I do think however that it did turn out good in the end after a couple of changes done.</p>
      
    <h1>20-Jan-2023</h1>
   <p>A technical challenge I faced this week using canva. I had to make models of how the finished product would look like for our group. To accomplish this goal I had to figure out how canva works and make multiple different models in different styles. This proved to be challenging because I have never used canva and it was foreign to me. </p>

   <p>A scheduling challenge we faced was getting everyone together to discuss what to do. This was difficult because not everyone regularly checks the discord to see new developments. This leads to some people being out of the loop and confused. This week was especially bad because we had Monday off and it took some getting used to, to get back into the swing of things. </p>

   <p>An interpersonal challenge I faced was communicating with my team leader on what exactly I was supposed to do. I was really confused on what I needed to do and I felt that I needed a lot more details and direction on where exactly they wanted the finished project to look like. I remedied the situation by making multiple different drafts of how the website could look in the end. </p>
    
    <h1>9-Jan-2023</h1>
	<p>
	  A big technical challenge I faced this week was github. My shell and github were not linked together so I had to try and connect them together. This was extremely confusing and took a while to complete. Even though I did find this hard it did help me understand more about github and how it works. This is sure to come in handy in the future with the model scheduler.
</p>
	 <p> Some scheduling challenges I faced this week was being confused on what exactly the other periods have completed. This led to me being behind on what they have already done. This led to me doing some extra work that was not needed in the end. Lastly it lead to me looking more closely at comments and what certain people have uploaded to github already.
</p>
	 <p> Some interpersonal challenges we faced in the group were deciding the jobs. Some people wanted to do jobs that already had enough members and some people didn’t want to do jobs that needed to be filled up. We rectified this by having a voting system where we voted for the project manager which was a contested spot. This led to the product manager sorting out who's doing what.	  </p>

	 <h1>2-Jan-2023</h1>
    <p><b><i>QA Engineer</i></b></p>
    <p>A Quality Assurance Engineer’s role is to look at the product and test for bugs before its release. This ensures the product works as intended and provides a satisfying experience. Additionally, it is their job to collaborate with developers to fix these bugs so that the customer gets the best experience possible. Without these members on the team the final product will be untested and thus be filled with bugs that would hinder the users experience.
<p><b><i>Project Manager </i></b></p>
    <p>A Project Manager's job is to lead the team working on the project to achieve all of their goals in the given time constraints. Additionally, they make sure that the project does not go over budget so as to not be profitable.  They work to make sure that everyone is working on the correct thing and that the team works diligently. Without these members on the team the team would not have anyone to make sure that they complete the project on time, within the budget, and that the teams as a whole was working on the correct things.</p>
      
    <p><b><i>Development Manager </i></b></p>
    <p>The role of the Development Manager in the group is to make the goals a reality. They additionally provide designs for the projects which help everyone else know how exactly the project should work. This is a very important job because if the whole team was not on the same page on what exactly the finished product will be, then the project would be a jumbled mess. The last role of a development engineer is to oversee a new product or series of products being produced.</p>
      
    <p><b><i>Product Manager </i></b></p>
    <p> The role of the Product Manager in a group is to look at what the consumers want from the product which ensures that the consumers would not be disappointed. This also ensures that the company will make a profit from the product. They also dictate what success would look like for the company financially. Additionally, they rally the time together so that they feel motivated to complete the project.</p>
      
    <p><b><i>Release Engineer </i></b></p>
      <p>The role the Release Engineer is to compile all the base code written. They then assemble this  base code written into the final product. Afterwards they deliver it into the correct points of the product so as to bring the project to life. The release engineers basically add all the moving parts together to bring the product into fruition.</p>
