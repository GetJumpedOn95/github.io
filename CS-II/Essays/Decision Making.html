   <h3>Decision Making</h3>

   <p>Over my time in school, I have discovered that, even though I like to think otherwise, I do have biases that affect my decision making and the work I complete. While these biases can be helpful, they could also adversely affect a project I am working on.</p>

   <p>The first bias I noticed that I have acquired is that I usually like to get things done fast so I don’t have to worry about it for a long period of time. This is commonly referred to as expedience bias (NeuroLeadership, 2022). This could lead to me getting ahead of the group and having to wait for people to catch up or lead to me getting ahead which could lead to my vision not lining up with the group’s vision.  For example, in the ISP when making the visuals of the scheduling program, I could do things that don’t line up with what the people are programming for it and have to go back and change it. Another possible outcome could be me finishing things quickly which could pressure other people to work faster and therefore make mistakes. A way I could try to overcome this is to learn to take my time and to ask my teammates how far along they are and just do everything until I'm as far as they have gone. This ensures I am not rushing my other teammates and that I am still up to date with the amount of work that needs to be done.</p>

   <p>Another bias I have taken note of is planning fallacy. This bias means that when planning everything, we just assume that the best case scenario will occur and no speed bumps will appear (Timely, 2022). This could negatively affect the team because when planning out the schedule for the work, I could think of only how things would go if we encounter no unexpected difficulties. This event I have described could occur in the isp when planning out what to do for the scheduler. This can be avoided if I ask other people what they think the time frame should be, or I could learn to take it easier and allow for extra time in each section of the ISP.</p>

   <p>An additional bias I noticed I have is confirmation bias. Confirmation bias can be defined as only looking for evidence that confirms one’s own belief(Timely, 2022). I’ve noticed when doing other projects that I tend to only listen to opinions or facts that line up with my own view on the matter. This could come up in the ISP where I could overlook facts about the model scheduler because it’s not how I view things should be.   Another way this could affect the ISP is if someone could voice their opinion, and I could overlook or ignore it because it doesn’t line up with my view of the model scheduler.  I can overcome this by training myself to learn and listen to other people’s views even if I disagree and take those views into account when making decisions.</p>

   <p>I also perceive that I have a framing effect bias. I tend to frame information in a way so that it benefits me the most. For example, on the ISP I could have information that’s important, and I might frame it in a way so that it leads to how I want the project done.  I can overcome this by trying to be impartial and just stating the facts as is.</p>

   <p>The last bias I have found within myself is the prospect theory where I will avoid favorable outcomes because I don’t know the chance of these outcomes coming into fruition.  This could occur during the ISP where we are deciding what to do, and I might avoid the best option due to me not knowing how probable it is to occur.  I can avoid this by thinking about what is best for the group and how these options can help the group succeed.</p>
