    <h1>AI Sentience</h1>

    <p>As technology rapidly advances new and interesting technologies emerge. One of the biggest and most controversial advances is the new steps AI sentience has taken. Personally, I am excited and think that these new strides will lead to the betterment of mankind.AI is basically a computer-made version of our human intelligence. This allows computers to work like our brains but work way faster and sometimes even smarter than our own. For example, The New York Times(2022)said that this new AI called the GPT-3 can analyze 175 billion data points that we use to piece words together, and using this it can generate computer programs, analyze text, and create conversations”(p.10). With this, we could solve problems and calculate solutions faster and maybe even better than we could with our own minds. If we were stuck on something like a math equation we could just ask the AI and it could provide us the answer so we can move on. Or we could ask the AI for the best solution for a problem and the AI can generate the best possible route we should take. Additionally AI can perform dangerous or tedious jobs that humans would have to do instead. This could lead to saving people's lives and freeing up humans to do more important or creative jobs that AI just can’t.</p>
