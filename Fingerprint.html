    <p>One of the main features of a https secure connection is that the data is encrypted so that nobody can break it. Another purpose is that it authenticates websites so that it can be verified that they who they claim to be. For example another website claiming to be wikipedia could be detected because the fingerprint from the fake website would not match the real website's fingerprint.</p> 

    <p>A https proxy appliance basically makes https even more secure than it was before. It does this by using firebox to encrypt the information when being sent and decrypt it after reaching its destination.</p>

    <p>A MITM or a man in the middle is an attack where a 3rd party tricks either the user or the website that everything is normal so that they can steal data. This is dangerous because by doing this someone can steal passwords, data, even credit card information.</p> 

    <p>A hash is an algirithom that changes the data to a different and usually shorter string value that maps to the orignal contents. If one character changes in the hash, the hash will not be able to be converted back to the original version. This is used in fingerprints so that if anything changes in the hash it will result in a completely different fingerprint which is easy to detect it is not authentic. To be a good and usable hash, the hash has to be able to able to consistently derive the original value and cannot not be easily hacked.</p> 

    <p>The CA or certificate authorities are a real life group that certifies websites by looking for things that prove that they are legitimite. After they have proven this, they sign a document that verifies who they are.</p> 

    <p>SSL intervention is impossible to prevent, but it can be detected later on. SSL interception can be spotted by looking at the fingerprint and seeing if anything has changed. A false positive is when a file or some other thing is labled as malicious when it is actually not. Large companies may use several different fingerprints for different regions. If two different fingerprints are compared from two different regions, then a false positive could be detected for the connection to this company being intercepted. On the other hand false negetives is when a file or something is malicious, but is not caught and therefore unseen.</p>

    <p>I don't think the school/goverment/ISP has the right to spy on us unless they have probable cause. This is because they could just spy on anyone at that point and it seems like an invasion of privacy.</p>
