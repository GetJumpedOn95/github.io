    <h1>FingerPrints</h1>
  <p>One of the main features of a https secure connection is that the data is encrypted so that nobody can break it.Another Purpose is that it authenticates websites so that they are who they claim they are.For example another website claiming to be wikipedia wouldn't work with https because it would be authenticated to make they are who they say they are.A https proxy appliance basically makes https even more secure than it was before.It does this by using firebox to encrypt the information when being sent and decrypt it after reaching it's destination.A MITM or a man in the middle is an attack where a 3rd party tricks either the user or the website that everything is normal so that they can steal data.This is dangerous because by doing this someone can steal passwords,data,even credit card information.A hash is a algirithom that makes changes almost the entire fingerprint left behind if you change even one bit of data.This allows people to easily see if anything has changed or been messed with.The CA or certificate authorities are a real life group that certifies websites by looking for things that prove that they are legitimite.After they have proven this they sign a document that says who they are.SSL intervention is impossible to prevent, but it can be detected later on.SSl interception can be spotted by looking at the fingerprint and seeing if anything has changed.
