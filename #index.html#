	  <h2>About Me</h2>
	  <p>Hello, I am Brayden Edington and I am a senior at Allen High School. I went to middle school at Ford Middle School and I went to Bolin Elementary School. I decided to take dual credit as to lessen my load in college. I wanted to get my basic classes out of the way and make more time for me to focus on my classes for my major.</p>
	  <p>I am currently looking at colleges in Texas. I want to go to UTD because of its high ranking engineering program. I recenlty toured the campus and I really liked it.</p>
	  <p>I have 3 sibling who all go to Allen schools and a dog named Leia. I swam for 5 years and was on the varsity swim team. I also am a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I still enjoy working out. My favorite hobby is playing video game because of what the medium can accomplish by you actually controlling the character in the game you are playing. My favorite book is Ender's Game and my favorite movie is Star Wars Episode 5.</p>
