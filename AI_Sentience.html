    <p>As technology rapidly advances new and interesting technologies emerge. One of the biggest and most controversial advances is the new steps AI sentience has taken. Personally, I am excited and think that these new strides will lead to the betterment of mankind. AI is basically a computer-made version of our human intelligence. This allows computers to work like our brains but work way faster and sometimes even smarter than our own. For example, The New York Times(2022) said that this new AI called the GPT-3 can analyze 175 billion data points that we use to piece words together, and using this it can generate computer programs, analyze text, and create conversations (p.10). With this, we could solve problems and calculate solutions faster and maybe even better than we could with our own minds. If we were stuck on something like a math equation we could just ask the AI and it could provide us with the best possible solution for the problem.
      Additionally AI can be used to AI generate the quickest possible traffic route. Another interesting way is that we are seeing the real-world applications of AI being integrated into cars. This allows cars to drive themselves and can help people get from places in a much safer and more efficient way. “The current technology on the market is limited to cars that will automatically brake for you if they anticipate a collision, cars that help keep you in your lane, and cars that can mostly handle highway driving.” (D’allegro,2022). Another interesting way AI could be implemented into cars is if two cars are about to collide the cars can communicate and safely avoid the crash whereas humans wouldn't be able to communicate while driving so they would crash.
      Additionally AI can perform dangerous or tedious jobs that humans would have to do instead. This could lead to saving people's lives and freeing up humans to do more important or creative jobs. In conclusion, AI can lead to huge strides in humanity and help us evolve drastically as a species.
