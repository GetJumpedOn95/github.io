	  <h1>Brayden Edington</h1>
	  <h2>why my Portfolio is important to me</h2>
	  <p>This digital portfolio is important to me because it includes all my achievements and things about me that I take pride in.
	  <p>For example it includes things about my ISP which took alot of work and it also includes my hobbys.Additionally it contains important and difficult classes I have taken in school which would demonstrate my knowledge.
	  <p> A digital portfolio can also prove to be beneficial to me in the future because,it allows me to test my coding skills by programing the entire portfolio digitally.
	  <p>  It may also prove useful because I could utilize it to showcase my accomplishments and programming skill to anybody looking to hire me.This would not only demonstrate my programming prowess, but it would also show all the regular things people are looking for in a job interview.
