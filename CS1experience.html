	  <h2>CS1 experience</h2>
	  <p>Comp sci 1 taught me a lot of things including teaching me how to use emacs so I can navigate and code.This is really important because if you can't navigate a text editor properly then you can't actually code no matter how much you know.Another thing the class taught me was swift which is a very common coding language that I could end up using a lot later on in my coding career.Learning swift enabled me to create actual games that you could play which was my ISP and other things like an algorithm to find how many coins I need to pay a certain amount.
