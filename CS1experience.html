	  <h2>CS1 experience</h2>
	  <p>Comp sci 1 taught me alot of things including teaching me how to use emacs so I can navigate and code.This is really important becasue if you can't navigate a text editor properly than you can't actually code no matter how much you know.Another thing the class taught me was swift which is a very common coding language that I could end up using alot later on in my coding career.Learning swift enabled me to create actual games that you could play which was my ISP and other things like a algirithom to find how many coins I need to pay a certain amount.
