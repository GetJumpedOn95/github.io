  <h1>Brayden Edington</h1>
  <h2>CS1 experience</h2>
	  <p>Computer Science 1 taught me a lot of things. Initially, it taught me about Linux and the differences between Linux and Windows. Some of the things it taught me was how to edit files in Linux with emacs and how to navigate around a Linux file system. This is really important because if you cannot navigate and use a text editor properly then you will not be able to code no matter how much you know. Another thing the class taught me was to program in Swift. Swift is a very common coding language that I could end up using a lot later on in my coding career. Learning Swift enabled me to create actual games that you could play which was my ISP and other things like an algorithm to find how many coins I need to pay a certain amount.
