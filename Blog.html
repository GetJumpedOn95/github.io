<p>I think that the downfall of Chegg is just a part of the free market and the survival of the fittest and that chat gpt taking the place of Chegg was destined to happen. Chat gpt provides better services for free and the answers are better and more easily obtainable. This is in stark contrast with Chegg which provides answers which are less reliable and cost money. Chat gpt is providing a better service that you can't find in many other places. Chegg could come back from this by innovating their service which would put them back at the top, but if they continue to make no innovations then they will continue their downward trajectory</p>
